# Liquid-Level-Control-System-Fault-Diagnosis-Data

This repository accompanies the research publication "A Comprehensive Experimental
Liquid-Level Control System for Advancing Fault Diagnosis Research Innovation: Data,
Models, and Procedures," authored by Hilina Workneh and Ioannis Raptis, and submitted
to the journal ASME Letters in Dynamic Systems and Control.

The repository contains two main folders. Each folder houses data record files from
various sensors used in the experimental setup described in the paper. The filenames
describe the type of sensory data. Details about the sensors and their respective
measurements can be found in the journal article. A Matlab .mlx file provides
a verbal and visual description of the data.
